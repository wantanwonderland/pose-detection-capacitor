# Pose Detection App with MoveNet

This is an Ionic Capacitor application that utilizes TensorFlow.js and the MoveNet model for real-time pose detection in the browser using the device's webcam.

## Features

- Real-time pose detection using the MoveNet model.
- Skeleton visualization on the canvas overlaying the webcam feed.
- Responsive design that works on both mobile and desktop devices.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Node.js and npm installed (preferably version 12 or above).
- Ionic CLI installed globally. If not installed, run:
  ```bash
  npm install -g @ionic/cli
  ```

- Capacitor CLI installed globally. If not installed, run:
  ```bash
  npm install -g @capacitor/cli
  ```

- Android Studio or Xcode installed for mobile development (if you plan to deploy on mobile).

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd pose-detection-app
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Install TensorFlow.js and MoveNet Model:**
   Make sure TensorFlow.js and the MoveNet model are included in your project:
   ```bash
   npm install @tensorflow/tfjs @tensorflow-models/pose-detection
   ```

4. **Run the application:**
   To run the application in a web browser:
   ```bash
   ionic serve
   ```

5. **Build for Android/iOS:**
   To build the application for Android or iOS, make sure to add the platforms:
   ```bash
   ionic capacitor add android
   ionic capacitor add ios
   ```

   Then, run the following command to open the project in the native IDE:
   ```bash
   ionic capacitor open android
   # or for iOS
   ionic capacitor open ios
   ```

## Usage

Once the application is running, you can:

- Allow access to your device's webcam.
- Toggle pose detection on or off.
- View the detected poses with skeleton visualization on the canvas overlay.
